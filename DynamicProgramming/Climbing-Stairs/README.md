# Climbing Stairs

Find all the possible combinations that will take you to the top with the constraint that you can only climb 1 step or 2 steps at a time. Therefore, at each stage you either have the option of stepping on it or skipping it, principle of dynamic programming.


## Complexity
- The Time complexity of this solution is O(n).
- The Space complexity of this solution is O(1)

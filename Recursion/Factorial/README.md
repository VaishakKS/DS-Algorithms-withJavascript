# Factorial 

Factorial, in mathematics, the product of all positive integers less than or equal to a given positive integer and denoted by that integer and an exclamation point. Thus, factorial seven is written **7!**
Thus, 7! =  1 × 2 × 3 × 4 × 5 × 6 × 7 = 5040. 

**Note:** Factorial zero (0!) is equal to 1.

## Time Complexity 

The algorithm to find factorial of a number using recursion is linear, running in `O(n)` time.<br>
This is the case because it executes once every time it decrements the value n, and it decrements the value n until it reaches 0, meaning the function is called recursively n times.
